# Flipkart Grid-4 Smart India Hackathon(Semi-Finalist)

**Problem Statement: Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs**

The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.
* Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.
* For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows
customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
* Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of
their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
* The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track
repairs and replacements to the original item.
* Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.
* You can use the Polygon blockchain to deploy your solution and demo the final product as a web prototype



**Solution statement/ Proposed approach**


* We have created a React App which serves as a GUI that helps users to a mint a Digital Warranty NFT of their product.<br />
* Upon landing on the GUI, first we have to simply click on connect my wallet button ,so that the NFT will be generated in that account.<br />
* The user will be asked whether he is  new user or and existing user and fill the details accordingly.<br />
* For new user two NFTs will be generated Warranty NFT and Level NFT , for existing Warranty NFT will be generated and his corresponding Level NFT will be updated.
* Warranty NFT is to prove the ownership of product and it is static.<br />
* Level NFT is a dynamic NFT which will increase itâ€™s level attribute when we register for new product with the same wallet address . This NFT can be used to add any    engagement/Gamification construct to the loyalty program.<br />
* Upon entering the details we have to click mint button and NFTs will be generated in our wallet address.<br />
* The minted NFTS can be viewed using Openseas.testnet<br />
* The NFTs generated are transferable. <br />
* These NFTs are burnable i.e these NFTs will be decomposed automatically after a period of six months from the date of purchase.<br />
